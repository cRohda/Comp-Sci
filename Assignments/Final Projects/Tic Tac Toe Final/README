- This directory contains my final project for BC High computer programming
- Multiple Files are used, they must be stored in the same directory. Run the file 'main.py'
- The files that should be there are
    - main.py    (executes functions and other main code)
    - func.py    (stores functions to be used during the game)
    - AI.py      (stores functions for AI use)
    - window.py  (runs code to open and interact with window)
    - Goals.txt
    - README.txt
- With any of these files missing the program will likely not run correctly

HOW IT WORKS:
